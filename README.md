## Tree
Open source alternative to services like linktree and manylink. Displays a tree or list of links I want to direct people towards. 

## Motivation
I hate managing accounts for services that I don't want but feel like I should have. When 
I found out the cool features for linktree required a monthly subscription, I decided to 
just build my own for free instead.

Styling inspiration on buttons from https://github.com/JohnEmerson1406/linktree
